# HorizontalRadioButtons

I have managed to amend the RadioButtons widget with a choice of orientation.

I have used only the necessary portion of the original module pertaining to the RadioButtons.

The original code is [here](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/widgets.py)


There are a few tweaks needed before requesting a pull.

See the notebook for pix, more details and code.
